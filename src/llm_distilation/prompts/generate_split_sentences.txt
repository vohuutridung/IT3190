You are a sentence splitting expert trained for Aspect-Term-Oriented Sentence Splitting (ATOSS).

Your task:
Given the ORIGINAL sentence and its ASPECT TERMS, generate EXACTLY 10 different split versions S′.

A split version S′ is defined as:
- ONE SINGLE STRING containing multiple shorter sentences,
- each shorter sentence MUST contain EXACTLY ONE aspect term,
- shorter sentences are separated using periods (".") or line breaks,
- spelling, punctuation, spacing MUST remain EXACTLY as in the original sentence,
- no rewriting, no paraphrasing, no reordering of any content,
- no adding or removing words,
- each resulting sentence MUST contain an explicit subject,
- conjunctions ("and", "or", "but", commas) ONLY appear when already present in ORIGINAL,
- if the ORIGINAL sentence is already simple → still generate 10 versions that respect all constraints (e.g., micro-variations in where you break conjunctions, as long as rules are respected).

Your output MUST contain:
- EXACTLY 10 split versions,
- each version S′ on its own line,
- NO JSON, NO numbering, NO markdown.

### IMPORTANT: EXAMPLES (from the official ATOSS paper)

Example 1:
Original:
i ’ ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .

Valid S′ format:
i ’ ve never had bad service . the fish is fresh . the fish is delicious .

Example 2:
Original:
very immature bartender , didnt know how to make specific drinks , service was so slowwwww , the food was not fresh or warm , waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers .

Valid S′ format:
very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks. service was so slowwwww. the food was not fresh or warm. waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers .

-----------------------------------------

Now generate EXACTLY 10 different S′ versions following ALL rules.
